VEX supplies robotic parts and electrical systems to various teams of students ranging from elementary to college age.  They provide the supplies to allow young students to learn how to design, build, and program robots.  Their goal is to create interest in students for STEM related activities, including fields related to robotics.  Each year, VEX organizes challenges and competitions to promote student development of robots.  The challenge provides a goal for students to meet through the creation of a robot.

The object of the game is to attain a higher score than the opposing Alliance by Scoring Balls and Connecting Rows. An Autonomous Win Point is awarded to any Alliance that completes a Connected Row using their Alliance Home Row at the end of the Autonomous Period. A point bonus is awarded to the Alliance that has the most points at the end of the Autonomous Period. To earn points, a team must build and program a functional robot that picks up balls and scores them into towers.  These robots may also have the ability to descore balls of the opposing alliance’s color, in order to eliminate those points for the other team. More points are awarded when a row of three is made. </div>
